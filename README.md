HTML
JavaScript
How to Run the Program
To run the program, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Program Details
The program consists of a single HTML file, which contains a form with an input field for the student's score and a button to calculate their grade. The JavaScript code in index.js handles the calculation of the grade and updates the page with the result.

The grading system works as follows:

A score of 80-100 is an A
A score of 60-79 is a B
A score of 50-59 is a C
A score of 45-49 is a D
A score of 0-44 is an E
Any other score is considered invalid
